## Welcome to Anthrocon

Join us for our annual convention every summer as we celebrate anthropomorphics,
which are human-like animal characters,
such as have fascinated mankind since the dawn of human imagination.
We are a collection of artists, animators, writers, costumers, puppeteers,
and just everyday fans who enjoy cartoon animals and their kin.
