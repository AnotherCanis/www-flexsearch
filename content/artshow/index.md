{{< center >}}# Anthrocon Art Show{{< /center >}}

{{< center >}}Anthrocon 2023 was an amazing convention, with attendance of 13,644 and more than 150 artists participating in the Art Show. Sales are now being tallied, and payment checks will be issued by August 31.{{< /center >}}

## UNCLAIMED ARTWORK

A number of people did not pick up and pay for their artwork at the con. In many cases, it was one or two pieces overlooked, which is understandable given the amount of artwork involved. Some people may have had to leave early because of travel arrangements. A small number of people may have decided they just didn't want to wait in line, in which case if they repeat such behavior, they will be unwelcome to bid in future Art Shows.

All of the unclaimed artwork is now in the possession of the Art Show Director, who will contact each buyer with details and payment options. If you receive such a notice, please respond promptly. We must settle the matter quickly and close the books before our fiscal year ends August 31. Carrying these over to next year's books is an accounting headache.

## ARTIST PAYMENTS INFORMATION

***When will I get my check?*** Payments for sales are issued by August 31. Of course, allow a few days' delivery time for your check actually to arrive. Payments outside the USA are sent by air mail. International funds transfers may take as much as an extra week to arrange.

To tally the sales, the bid sheets for every item sold (over a thousand) are sorted by artist. When you checked out at the end of the Art Show, we made a note of how many pieces you've sold. Then we can tell, as we're sorting the bid sheets, when we've done all the bid sheets for your pieces, and we can compare the bid sheets with your Control Form to make sure all pieces are accounted for, calculate the payment amount, and write and send you your check.

However, if there is some irregularity in your paperwork, or if you did not sell all your artwork and neglected to check out, we can't figure out and solve the problem until all the bid sheets have been sorted, so you will be among the last paid. (In reality the "sorting" is all done on computer, but this describes the method -- and, in case of computer failure, it could all be done manually.)

***How can I get paid faster?*** Please notify us if your address changes, and (especially if you're sharing a residence with someone else) make sure you inform your local Post Office of your current address. Checks are sent by first class mail, which the Post Office may not deliver if they don't have the addressee's name on file as residing at the address indicated. (Unlike junk mail which gets delivered anyway, no matter to whom it's addressed.) Make sure there's a label with your name on your mailbox, too.

***What if my check gets lost or destroyed?*** If you haven't received your payment by September 15, please contact [{{< uncderline >}}**artshow@anthrocon.org**{{< /underline >}}](mailto:artshow@anthrocon.org). Mail does get misdirected or delayed. Sometimes it gets returned marked "addressee unknown" for no apparent reason. That's why we ask for your phone number -- we'll never call except in critical situations such as this, when there's no other way to contact you.

If you do receive your check but the dog eats it, it goes through the laundry, etc. just let us know, we'll send you a replacement. Don't try to fool us and cash both of them, though -- that'll get you permanently banned, and we may file fraud charges.

***Will I get paid faster if I complain to Kage, or in public, about it?*** No. Kage has nothing to do with tallying up the Art Show sales. That's all done by the Art Show Director, Peter Kappesser (PeterCat), who runs his own business as well as having family obligations which must take precedence over Anthrocon matters. It takes as long as it takes to tally up the sales, and payments are issued as quickly as possible, balancing all the circumstances. Public comments only delay things, as time is spent responding to the comments instead of processing payments.

***How come other cons can pay more quickly, or even at the con?*** Good for them! This is a keen technological challenge, made more complicated by Anthrocon’s size and the standards under which we operate. Unlike many other cons, which close bidding Saturday night and spend hours after doing bookkeeping, Anthrocon allows bidding on Sunday morning and closes bidding at noon. We feel this “feeding frenzy” generates excitement for the voice auction, and makes more money for the artists. We’re building up our technical infrastructure to provide faster payment processing in the future.

***Will I find out the price each piece sold for, and who bought it?*** Yes, with your payment check you will receive a sales report listing the price for each piece sold, when it sold (bid line or at auction), and the buyer’s name (and contact info, if they gave us permission to share it).

## Information for 2024

After payments are done, we'll be taking a few months off to recuperate and get things organized for next year. The artists' information packet with the display rules and a space reservation form will be available early next year. To receive one, please send your full (legal) name and postal address to [**artshow@anthrocon.org**](mailto:artshow@anthrocon.org) and you will be placed on our mailing list for the next Anthrocon.
