**Rabbit Wranglers** is a Pittsburgh-based all-volunteer nonprofit organization. Their mission is to help abused, neglected and abandoned rabbits and educate the public to improve the lives of these companion animals.

Since its inception, Rabbit Wranglers’ primary accomplishments include: rescuing abused, neglected and abandoned rabbits; assisting shelters with their high maintenance cases and overflow population; providing medical, hospice and behavior rabbits safe harbor and state of the art care; and finding them loving and permanent indoor homes. The organization has also been successful in educating the public about the unique nature and proper care of these intelligent companion animals. Additionally, Rabbit Wranglers has become a community resource by providing services or supplies that help negate the need for surrender, while also finding ways to capture abandoned rabbits.

In recent years, they have been heartened to extend these services not only in Pennsylvania and adjacent states, West Virginia, New York and Ohio, but also all the way to New Jersey, Florida, Missouri, Texas and Nevada. In 2021, Rabbit Wranglers took an active role in preventing the progression of the deadly Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease in our region by educating our community about the threat and initiated low-cost clinics for vaccination services.

{{< center >}}## Charity Auction and Raffle{{< /center >}}

The Anthrocon Charity Auction is an event on Sunday afternoon of the convention that offers items and products unique to the convention to bidders to raise money for a charity, chosen annually by the convention. The Raffle has the same purpose, but is a ticket-driven event over Friday and Saturday that accepts non-unique items and merchandise, with all winning ticket numbers presented during Sunday's Dealers Room hours. Higher value donations are sold at the auction. Lower value items are raffled at the charity's Dealers Room table.

### How do I participate in Anthrocon’s Live Charity Auction?

On Sunday of the convention, you’ll have the ability to participate in the live Charity Auction for items that are specifically presented by our auctioneer. Check the schedule on the [**Events page**](/events-panels) closer to the convention dates for the exact time of the auction.

Interested in donating to the Anthrocon Charity Auction or Raffle? Send an email to [**charity@anthrocon.org**](mailto:charity@anthrocon.org) stating what you are donating, your name, your preferred email address if it's different, and details on the donation (what is it, medium, artist/donor, etc.). This information is for approval purposes only - details should be provided with the required information card at the convention.

{{< details "Rules for donating items" >}}
If you are donating an item (artwork, sculpture, animation cel, etc), it must be G to PG rated (PG13- or R-rated items accepted only with prior permission). You may either bring it to Anthrocon if you are attending or you may send it via postal mail. Write to [**charity@anthrocon.org**](mailto:charity@anthrocon.org) to receive the address that postal mail items should be sent to. If delivered by mail, the item must include a 3x5 card with pertinent, legible information such as the donor, artist, medium, and any other important information a bidder or ticket-holder should know so that the item may be properly auctioned or raffled. If delivered at the convention, please do so at the charity's Dealers' Room table during Dealers' Room Setup hours on Friday. You will be required to fill out a 3x5 card with the aforementioned information for display and/or auction purposes. Items donated for the auction must be unique - they cannot be available anywhere else at the convention. And please: we appreciate your generosity, but do not donate multiple copies of the same item!

Additional information and more detailed rules can be found on the [**Charity Event Rules**](/charity-event-rules) page.

**A currently valid 501(c)3.**

**An organization related to or associated with helping animals.**

**Parent organization headquartered within 60 miles of the Pittsburgh metro area.**
