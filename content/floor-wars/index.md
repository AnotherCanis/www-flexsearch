**What is Floor Wars?** It’s an all-styles dance battle event, first hosted by Last-Fur-One at Anthrocon 2012, that has taken the furry fandom by storm. Dancers compete against each other as they are given a variety of songs by the DJ to “battle” to, taking turns to show who’s got the edge over the other.

**The format for Anthrocon 2024 Floor Wars will be announced in Spring 2024.** Check back later for more details.

{{< center >}}## Competition format{{< /center >}}

Please read through each section carefully, as it will help you with what to expect and prepare for.

### preliminaries event - Friday, JUly 5TH

- **The format for Anthrocon 2024 Floor Wars will be announced in Spring 2024.** Check back later for more details.
- **All dancers will compete in a “showcase round”** where we see the raw skill and talent of each team to a non-stop, continuous mix of music that can be any genre. These skill rounds will be between 30-45 seconds each dancer, so make sure you come ready to impress.

### Main Event - Saturday, July 6th

If your team qualifies for the Main Event**,** you will be automatically slotted into a battle bracket for the division. The date and times of the Main Event will be announced on all Anthrocon’s channels.

- **Teams will compete in a single-elimination tournament**, where the winning team advances to the next round.
- **Each dancer on the team will dance once per round, with each turn being 30 to 45 seconds.** If a team performs a routine, it will count as a “turn”.
- **In the event of a tiebreaker**, each team will choose one dancer to compete in an all-or-nothing round. There will be no second tiebreakers.
- **In the Finals of each division,** there will be extra rounds meaning that teams will need to prepare for additional rounds. This is to test the endurance of the team that wants to be the winner.

### Judging guidelines

A brief example of some things that our judges look for in both the Preliminaries and Main Event:

- **Execution**: How clean and polished do your moves look?
- **Originality**: Do your moves look unique and non-repetitive?
- **Musicality**: How well does your dance match the music?
- **Dynamics**: How dynamic and/or exciting is your dance?
- **Response**: Does your dance directly respond to the battle, and your opponent(s)?

**Prizes:** Historically, prizes have come in the form of plaques and/or medals distributed to the winning competitors. Additional rewards may be determined closer to the event. Floor Wars is an event to enjoy and celebrate the modern dance culture – we promote an environment that is focused on celebrating the furry dance community, rather than competing for status or reward.

{{< center >}}## Frequently Asked Questions{{< /center >}}

**Am I allowed to participate if I’m a minor? Are there any age restrictions to the competition?**

No, there are no longer any age restrictions for Floor Wars. However if you are a minor, you will need to follow the rules for minors requiring chaperones as outlined in our [**Minors 13 and Under section**](/faq/minors-questions).

**I don’t have a certain fursuit part or accessory that is needed to compete. What should I do?**

We acknowledge that it may be difficult for some competitors to meet the minimum requirements for our competition. In the event that you are missing a piece or part of a fursuit, such as hands or feet, we would recommend reaching out to your local community or furry network to see if you are able to borrow parts for the competition. Furries are very generous folks, and many are willing to lend a hand (literally) if you ask nicely!

**What kind of music/genre/style can we expect for Floor Wars?**

As an all-styles competition, all sorts of genres can and will be played! Check out the following list (and examples on YouTube) of some music genres you can prepare for:

- Funk
- Pop
- Hip-Hop (Old School and New School)
- Trap/Dubstep
- Battle Beats

**Is the event livestreamed anywhere to watch?**

Yes, we plan to have an official livestream on the Anthrocon channel for the in-person Main Event. Further details will be announced and posted to our website.

**Will the Floor Wars host finally have his floor cleaned of Doritos being thrown on it?**

It better be.
