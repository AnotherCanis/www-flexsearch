As you may have heard, Anthrocon's selected charity this year is PEARL &nbsp;Parrot Rescue. While cash donations made at the convention are great,&nbsp;the plurality of funds are raised via donations of artwork and &nbsp;merchandise to our Charity Auction and Raffle. We're looking for popular &nbsp;items and unique craftwork that will make people say, "I want that!"

Here are some examples of donations that went big in past years...

Great examples from prior raffles:

- Crafts based on hot trends &nbsp;("Toothless" Build-A-Bear plus - $381)
- Popular media (Sherlock Hound &nbsp;DVD set - $147)
- Art bought at prior convention art shows ("Wrath" art &nbsp;by Terrie Smith - $83)
- Giant, brand new plush of popular animals or &nbsp;characters (Border collie plush - $129)
- Merchandise based on popular &nbsp;fiction (Dr. Who's sonic screwdriver - $158)
- Gift cards (Amazon $100 &nbsp;gift card - $305).

Great examples from prior auctions:

- Fursuit costumes and commissions &nbsp;(Griffon fursuit head - $460)
- Rare convention memorabilia (Full set of &nbsp;all AC t-shirts since 1997 - $200)
- Professional sculpture (Softsculp &nbsp;poseable gryphon - $350)
- Unique opportunities (A speaking part in audio &nbsp;version of Diane Duane's "The Last Meow" - $500)
- Dorsai fursuit tags &nbsp;(Tag #1000 - $1600)
- Contemporary culture ("Zootropolis" movie poster -&nbsp;$300)
