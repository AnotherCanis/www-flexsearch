Disclaimers for registration tiers


--------------------------------------

**\* Note for Sponsor, Supersponsor, and Ultrasponsor:** A portion of this membership constitutes a donation to Anthrocon which, by law, is not tax-deductible and is not refundable if your registration is canceled.  For more information, please see [**our refund policy**](https://www.anthrocon.org/refundpolicy).

**\*\* Note for Advance Hotel Reservations:** The higher demand hotels (such as the Westin, Courtyard and the Drury) will have a number of rooms set aside for the general reservation opening.  This is done to ensure that no hotel sells out completely before the general opening and to give all attendees a chance to reserve a room in the higher demand hotels. You may see a hotel sell out during the advanced reservation period but once again have rooms available during general reservations. For more information about available hotels, see [**our hotels page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/hotel).

If you are attending Anthrocon and are **under the age of 18 by** **July 4th, 2024**, you must bring a completed and notarized Minor Consent Form in order to pick up your registration. If you are under the age of 13 and attending with an adult who is not your parent or legal guardian, you must also bring a completed and notarized Assignment of Responsibility form.

**Minor Consent Form**

This form is required for any minor attending the convention, either with or without the supervision of their parent or legal guardian.

**Assignment of Responsibility**

Required for attendees who are under 13 years of age and attending Anthrocon 2024 with an adult other than their parent or legal guardian.

Frequently Asked Questions


------------------------------

*   For all attendees aged 18 years and older, we require a government-issued photo ID so that we can make sure nobody other than you is trying to pick up your badge or register in your name. Anthrocon accepts the following as a single-form ID: USA or Canada Driver's License, USA or Canada State ID, USA Military ID, or a Passport.

    For minor attendees aged 13-17 years old, we prefer to have a government-issued photo ID as well.   However, we do understand that not every minor (especially the younger ones) will have an ID.  If you do not have any of the above, we still need something with your photo on it that will confirm your identity and your date of birth. Contact the Registration department at [**\[email protected\]**](https://www.anthrocon.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7b091e1c12080f091a0f1214153b1a150f1309141814155514091c) [\[email protected\]](https://www.anthrocon.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you are unsure or need assistance in determining alternate forms of acceptable ID.

*   There are multiple options for both adults and minors to get a state-issued photo ID. Please ensure that you have a valid form of ID to get your registration badge before the convention; if you need help, consult your state or province’s government services to see what options are available.

*   Absolutely! All you need to do is click on the link that was emailed to you with your registration confirmation. It will take you to your registration summary, and you need only click "Sponsor" or "Supersponsor" at the top and then "Update My Info" at the bottom.

*   Anthrocon will have ADA lines that are available at registration for those who are unable to stand in line, for whatever reason.

*   We understand that circumstances may arise that prevent you from attending our convention. Requests for refunds must be received before the close of pre-registration. Requests for rollovers must be received before the Monday prior to the convention. For more information please visit our [**refund policy page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/refundpolicy).

*   If your child is between the ages of 13 to 17, they do not require accompaniment within the convention space as long as they have a valid Minor badge (which requires the completion of a [**Minor Consent form**](#forms)). If you wish to accompany them, you will need to purchase a registration badge for yourself.

    Please note that children 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult (18 years or older) at all times, whether they purchase a PUP badge or not. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or legal guardian a signed and notarized [**Parental Assignment for Supervision of Minor Child form**](#forms) must be completed and turned in at registration. PUP badges include the price for the child only. Membership for the parent/guardian will need to be purchased separately.
