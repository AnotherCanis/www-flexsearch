# Driving and Hotel Shuttles

If you're traveling by car, this is the address to put into your navigation system to get to the convention center:

**Anthrocon Furry Convention**
1000 Fort Duquesne Boulevard
Pittsburgh, PA 15222

The closest major international airport to the convention is the [**Pittsburgh International Airport**](http://www.flypittsburgh.com/), airport code (**PIT)**. It is highly recommended due to its variety of airlines, its proximity, and the availability of public transportation. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (**LBE**) may be a consideration for those traveling from Florida, but requires a car rental and over an hour of driving to reach Pittsburgh.

Once you arrive in Pittsburgh, there are many ways to get to your hotel:

- [**The 28X "Airport Flyer"**](https://www.portauthority.org/pdfs/28X.pdf): The cheapest way to get downtown from the airport. The three “Downtown Pittsburgh" stops are the closest to our partner hotels. Make sure to look at the maps and timetables in the link to find the best one, and note that weekdays, Saturday and Sunday schedules all differ.

### Travel by Bus

[**Greyhound**](https://www.greyhound.com/) operates a bus terminal across the street from The Westin.

Other public transit options including the local [**Pittsburgh Regional Transit**](https://www.rideprt.org/inside-Pittsburgh-Regional-Transit/rider-info/how-to-ride/how-to-ride-the-bus/) are useful for traveling around the city, should you need it. Find out more information on their website.

### Taking the Train

Anthrocon members who live in the Northeast Corridor and the upper Midwest may wish to consider taking a train to Anthrocon. It is more convenient than driving, and usually costs less than airfare. [**Amtrak**](http://www.amtrak.com/) offers rail service to the **Pittsburgh Rail Station (PGH)**, which is right across the street from the Westin Hotel, at **1100 Liberty Ave**.

The station is serviced by Amtrak's [**Capitol Limited**](https://www.amtrak.com/capitol-limited-train), running Chicago-Cleveland-Pittsburgh-Washington DC and points between, and [**Pennsylvanian**](https://www.amtrak.com/pennsylvanian-train), running Pittsburgh-Philadelphia-New York and points between.
